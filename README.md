👋 \
Hi, I'm Airdj.\

💼 \
I'm a Junior Python Developer, currently wading through the piles of datasets.\

👨‍💻 \
I'm a person who is deeply involved in the tasks I deal with, appreciating working with experienced people.\
I have a high independence factor(before I ask a reasonable question and waste someone's time, I will search all available sources first).\
I also feel great in teamwork because, in the first place, I focus on transparent and precise communication.\
I have an open mind, thanks to which I am not afraid of innovation, because I believe that programming is not only based on patterns,\
but also a creative activity open to new ideas.\
